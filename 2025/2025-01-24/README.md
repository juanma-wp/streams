ðŸŽ¥ **Watch this session on YouTube:** [Getting started with the Interactivity API](https://youtu.be/gn2W7evoUlk)

In this session I provide a walkthrough of the WordPress Interactivity API, a feature introduced in WordPress 6.5. The Interactivity API offers a standardized way to add interactivity to the frontend of WordPress sites, enabling developers to create dynamic, performant experiences.

This session covers:

An introduction to the Interactivity API and its purpose.

- The concept of directives, such as data-wp-interactive, and their role in linking HTML elements to interactive behavior.
- The use of state management, including global state, local context, and derived state.
- The difference between declarative and imperative coding approaches.
- A live demonstration of scaffolding a plugin using the Interactivity API.
- A breakdown of key files (block.json, render.php, and view.js) and how they interact.
- Examples of creating dynamic blocks that manage state, toggle themes, and enable features like countdown timers.
