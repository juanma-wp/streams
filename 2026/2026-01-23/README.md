In this live stream, we explore the **PHP AI Client SDK** and how it fits into the emerging AI stack around WordPress. We map it alongside the **Abilities API**, the **MCP adapter**, and the **AI Experiments** plugin, then dig into what “provider-agnostic” AI integration really means for plugin developers: one interface, multiple model providers, and fewer repeated SDK/credential implementations across the ecosystem.

In the second half, we go hands-on. We scaffold a **minimal WordPress plugin** that pulls the SDK in via Composer, try to run simple text generation from a local WP environment (including via WP-CLI), and then troubleshoot the classic “provider not configured / no models found” situation by tracing how provider discovery and credentials are expected to work.

It’s practical, a bit messy (in a good way), and ends with a clear next step: a follow-up session to complete a successful end-to-end call once the initialization/config pieces are fully nailed down.
